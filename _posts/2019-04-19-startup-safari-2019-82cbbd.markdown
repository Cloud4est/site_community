Yesterday was pretty busy... although I only had to leave at 7, catch the train at 7:14, I arrived in Budapest at 10:24, then hurried to CEU iLab where my first program was held.

So that's how it all started, because we took part in the **[Budapest Startup Safari](https://budapest.startupsafari.com/)**.

This was the second occasion after the previous year, which also went really well. Our concept was a bit different from last year's: we've picked different programs now, and went on our own. To our surprise we met each other in the end just a few streets away from Anker köz, where [Ádám](https://cloud4est.github.io/site_community/authors/adam-nagy-hu/) greeted us with the following question:

> "What's up? Have we already grown out of this city too?"

Now a bit about my experience. First, the programs I've chosen:

* [Create your first blockchain application](https://budapest.startupsafari.com/agenda/?es_session_date=2019-04-18#session_1094)

* [Developing cross-platform AR applications](https://budapest.startupsafari.com/agenda/?es_session_date=2019-04-18#session_836) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/997313017324175/)

* [Development @Tekrama: The first years of the developer team](https://budapest.startupsafari.com/agenda/?es_session_date=2019-04-18#session_777)

* [How to build your first product? Bootsrap!](https://budapest.startupsafari.com/agenda/?es_session_date=2019-04-18#session_784) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/287177452216846/)

* [After your degree, as a developer](https://budapest.startupsafari.com/agenda/?es_session_date=2019-04-18#session_769) - [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/413094159490797/)

I enjoyed each of the programs, while being able to learn from every one of them. At some points I discovered the same struggles and problems we've also met with our team, but at the same time I also got some confirmation about the things we did right.

At first I was skeptical about the idea to participate in events 30 minutes right after the other at a whole different location, but in the end I didn't find it suffering and after all that's what a safari is about.

For the last event, I had the opportunity to take part in a very calm, personal and direct conversation in the office of [Codecool](https://codecool.com/), organized by the [Tech Embassy](https://techembassy.io/). Although it may not have been the goal of the previous programs, I missed this closer attitude from those. All in all some 10 participants were involved in this conversation, which resulted in a hugely relevant and helpful session.

There were many points during the conversation which made it clear that what we do at Cloud4est is kind of essential at university if you'd like to obtain deeper knowledge in a specific field. At the same time, it confirmed again that in our age, this sequence of extracurricular activities makes us much more open to any opportunities currently, but also at the time of being at university, which is a key to being successful. We had a brief talk about this with the organizers, we might cooperate in some ways to further develop and spread these ideas and create opportunities for anyone who is willing to take part. I'm truly happy for this.

So that's about the 2019 Startup Safari in "short" (yes, I still hope that it not too long for you to read...). It's possible that I'll be writing about the other programs as well, but until then, look forward to new content from our other channels too 😉.
