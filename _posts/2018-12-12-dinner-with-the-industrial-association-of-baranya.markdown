Yesterday night we had the opportunity to attend a dinner organized by a club of the Industrial Association of Baranya. During the event we were able to get to know a lot of interesting people, including the executive officer, the data privacy operator and organization developer of [Crossec Solutions](https://crosssec.com). The club consists of experts mainly connected to HR topics, so we were discussing our projects and the team as a whole in that regard. The atmosphere was really inspiring, they found our ideas and concepts quite interesting, on the other hand they also shared their doubts and suggestions. It was incredibly helpful for us to catch a glance at ourself through the other side of the coin. Furthermore we received a myriad of practical hints regarding team- and time management. They made it clear that projects need obvious deadlines and the number of our members need to be increased.
