I couldn't really understand the attitude that I met a few times, not long ago. It occurred when I started sharing the concept of Cloud4est and invited more people to join in, they reacted differently: generally they were keen on the idea, but there were some who responded skeptically. Those conversations usually evolved into some sort of debates, which I enjoyed (because that's sadly a rare opportunity in school, that's why I got to make use of it :D) But let's stay with the enthusiastic ones. Despite the reception, not everybody have joined or taken part in our activities actively. Many told me it was the matter of the question (or rather the lack of their answer): "In what way could I contribute to it?" 

So, that was one reason why we thought it would be useful if we started making courses. Apart from that, it was also about educating current members to get to the same level in an area. 

### ehm... What kind of courses?

> And anyway, whaaat?

Firstly we are starting with only a few courses, in the coming days or next week. All of them are going to be introductory / beginner courses, in order to let anyone join. Alright, what are the topics?

- **The basics of web development** (_MÃ¡rk Kuthy_ - HTML / CSS / JS)

- **Your own website, as you wish** (_Arnold Schelb_ - Jekyll)

- **What to do with a mini-computer?** (_Arnold Schelb_ - Raspberry Pi)

Hopefully, your questions have been answered by now. We are planning to organize the courses in person too, in addition to the online platforms, in order to progress easier and resolve problems, etc. But for more accessible content, we'll be uploading our education videos to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1aBUmUZTGBWwj5N9ktfx7w) so you can reach them anytime. In the meantime, we are also working on our education website, which we'll share if we are done with it (soon). We welcome anyone willing to participate, either online or in person. You don't have to wait that much... ;)
