Space Exploration is expensive. That's true but this is our future. If we don't put money into our futurity, humans will die out soon. 

When the space race started, the goal was to dominate the space. This was a really close race between the USA and USSR. 

When Jurij Gagarin hit the magical Kármán-line at 100km we got into a new chapter of humanity. Shortly after that, President Kennedy said that the US will get to the Moon. They started the Apollo program. Verner von Braun, the ex-nazi rocket scientist, who made V2 for the Third Reich, now making the Saturn V. The biggest rocket what people ever built. It was 110m tall and 2800tons. We made it to the Moon with this rocket. 

After the Moon-project we started to create space stations. Skylab, Mir, and currently we have the ISS. Only highly educated,well-trained people could work and live there, doing experiments.

But what about the future? We need to expand our territory to other planets in order to survive a potential disaster on one of our inhabited planets.

Space Exploration here comes as our hope. We must discover more about our universe before we go out and explore other planets. Recently, the most innovative company on the field is Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) with Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and in the future with Super Heavy/ BFR. They could get people on the surface of Mars until 2022. I think it's so exciting and we must try it. It's worth it.

Space exploration is technically "future exploration" because we are working for our better future. You can get really good insights about this topic by [cmd. Chris Hadfield's Masterclass](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-hadfield-teaches-space-exploration) or about the technical thing from the people who made it happen on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-the-space-shuttle).
