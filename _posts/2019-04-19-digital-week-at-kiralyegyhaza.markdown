We took part in the digital week held in the primary school of Királyegyháza.

The whole story begins a bit earlier, around March. We were invited to this event, in which the students get a bit more familiar with given topics. The main topic of this week was the digital world of today, the opportunities it gives us, but also the drawbacks it brings with them.

Honestly I didn't expect any invitation like that before I heard about it, but I looked at this occasion very positively from the start. We began to discuss the details, both with the school and inside our team as well. We came to the conclusion that we're going to do 3 workshops, which can fill the whole 2 hours we were given. This way every student could choose something he/she liked and at the same time we could showcase our activities in the group. The workshops were the following:

- [Ágota](https://community.cloud4est.com/authors/toth/) gave the **digital graphics** workshop with [Ádám](https://community.cloud4est.com/authors/adam-nagy-hu/),

- [Lilla](https://community.cloud4est.com/authors/kerklecz-lilla/) the **social media** workshop with Barni,

- Márk the **website development** workshop with [Arni](https://community.cloud4est.com/authors/schelb-arnold/)

We all enjoyed the whole day, everything went flawlessly and it gave us some experience on how to teach new things the most efficiently.

To my surprise I even met a 3D printer sitting in silently in the IT room, since it hasn't been set up correctly. This could be a future adventure as we're expecting additional cooperation with the school.
