Hello,

there was an idea a day before of a plan of a Google Form for data collecting purposes, which was created after a long time spent

with thinking and planning. We were very happy about, because it is not a big thing creating a Form. We tried to do it as energy-sparing as we could,

so we used a few but concrete questions with a big spectre of giveable answers. The plan was to have as many data from a question as possible,

then we separate them, change the synonyms to a given keyword, take the summary of the collected data and get a consequence from this. Furthermore, we wanted

the target audience (the highschoolers) to feel that it is some kind of a formal and helpful form in order not to write comic and/or unreal answers for

their own purpose. We just finished when someone pointed out, that our questions are not as optimal for data analyzation as we thought,

because of the answers in people's own word and the lot of synonymes they use. He said that it is easier to analyze a data from yes-no questions or

answers picked from a pre-made list. On the other hand, making a list would not let data to be that widely ranged. It was a question too

whether we need that kind of questions that gives us no direct information, just (according to some of us) have a psychological effect on the fillers.

As you can see, we have conflicts too. It happens obligately by groups bigger than one person. The not-aggreeing cannnot cause war and offendedness

amongt us as long as the debate is moderated. That is why we agreed to host a debate over the subject and ask the opinion of the audience, the readers

and yours too. Feel free to comment, argue, pick a side, suppose a better objective or make any notes! Your opinion counts too!
