Why should you start with website rather than an application?

Even in 2019.

I've been thinking about the question of accessibility regarding different digital platforms. I came to the conclusion that the **web** is still the **only technology** that **can be reached easily** from **any** of the used **platforms**. This way, it's the most efficient tool for us to use when it comes to reaching the biggest amount of people, regardless of what device they're using. This makes it so useful, even today: _it's able to connect people from all over the world, by exchanging data_.

This may be an unusual point of view, but in my opinion the reason why the internet still "survived" and hasn't been succeeded by other technologies, isn't obvious. The devices and platforms that we mostly use today, depend on the internet. That's why the role and importance of this invention is not something that can be questioned, not even in today's world.

Additionally, it should be mentioned that the **internet is evolving continously** as _new_ perspectives appear: **decentralized platforms and protocols, services not collecting user data**, which make for more _free (as in freedom)_, and therefore _more enjoyable user experience_. You can read about this question from another aspect in the [following article](https://www.atrium.co/blog/founders-should-build-website-not-mobile-app/).
