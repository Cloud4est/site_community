Who is Elon Musk?

You could read that he shoot his Tesla Roadster to space. You could pay via PayPal or you could travel by a Tesla. In the future, you can use Hyperloop, his free 4G internet connection and you can go to Mars by his rockets.

He was born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1971. His father was an engineer and his mother works as a model. 

He was a book-worm. He read through Encyclopedia Britannica (32 640 pages). He was bullied by his classmates. They broke his nose. Elon went back to books and learn a lot. 

At the age of 12, he wrote a computer game, named Blastar. (You can try it out [here](https://blastar-1984.appspot.com/)) A company bought the game for 500 Dollars. 

He went to Canada in order to study at universities and he ended up in the States.

He made Zip2, X.com, PayPal. He invested into Tesla Motors and created SpaceX.

After all, he is my idol. He set his goals and now, he fights for them. We need to be proactive and fight for our dreams too. That's the key point of success.
