External consultant of Cloud4est, student of psychology, an ordinary 90’s baby. I like to think of myself as a bridge, who connects the students and the mentors because I’m a student and also an adult with adult problems. I was an active teenager too, so I joined with nostalgic feelings, but now the Cloud4est project is a professional challenge for me. I study social psychology, technically I’m an intern here, but it’s also my hobby, my passion. Kill two birds with one stone. I’m a team player, the diversity of this group inspires me, but in my free time, I like being alone and watching series all night long
