_Open_ source / _Free_ software enthusiast. Nowadays my hobbies include: exploring interesting new projects, 3D printing and experimenting with model creation, website development, GNU/Linux + gadget "hacking" and so much more... Additionally, I'm interested in humans, I think I'm open to them. I would also like to mention animals and plants as additional _living_ organisms. _Founder @ Cloud4est_.
