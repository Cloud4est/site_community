__Open__ source / __Free__ software enthusiast, polymath wannabe (getting into everything). Nowadays my hobbies include: exploring software, 3D printing and experimenting with model making, website development, GNU/Linux + gadget "hacking" and so much more... Additionally, I'm interested in humans, I think I'm open to them. I would also like to mention animals and plants. _Founder @ Cloud4est_.
